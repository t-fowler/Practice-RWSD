# Practice-RWSD
This repository contains code that I wrote to practice the concepts from Real World Software Development (Urma &amp; Warburton). Chunks of code are used from the book as permitted, but I have endeavoured to re-write portions and implement new functionality suggested by the book for learning purposes.
