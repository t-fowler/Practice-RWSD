# Practice-RWSD
This repository contains code that I wrote to practice the concepts from <u> Real World Software Development </u> (Urma &amp; Warburton). Chunks of code are used from the book as permitted, but I have endeavoured to re-write portions and implement new functionality suggested by the book for learning purposes.

## Concepts Learned:
The concepts that <u> Real World Software Development </u> focuses on include:

* ### Java features

        The book covered topics such as Java packagages, exceptions, lambda expressions, method references, and type inference.

* ### Software architecture and design

        Some of the techniques explained in the book are concepts such as coupling/cohesion, fluent api design, event-driven architecures, and hexagonal architecures. A number of programming patterns are presented, including object-oriented patterns such as the Notification and Builder patterns, and functional programming patterns such as first-class functions and stream programming.

* ### SOLID design principles

        These principles are featured throughout the book and are the focus of the various projects that each chapter undertakes.

    * Single responsibility principle
        
            The SRP states that units of code should be entirely focused on a single task. This ensures that there is only ever one reason for the code to be modified. This promotes high cohesion and loose coupling by encouraging code to be organized by function. High cohesion and low coupling lead to code that is more easily readable and maintainable.

    * Open / Closed principle

            The OCP encourages the use of abstraction to make code easier to change in the future. By 

    * Liskov substitution principle

            The LSP

    * Interface segregation principle

            The ISP

    * Dependency inversion principle

            The DIP

* ### Testing
